# Notes:
# - This compose file is intended for production-like deployments where an external

#   SMTP_USER and SMTP_PASSWORD in your environment or a secure env_file before running.
# - Do NOT store secrets in the repository. Use your host or orchestration system's
#   secret manager to provide credentials.
